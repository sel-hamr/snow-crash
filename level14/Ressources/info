in level14 we found nothing in the home directory so we try to debug `getflag`

So we check out the getflag executable and debug it
And we find that we can get all the flags of all the other levels

So we add to breakpoint in 0x0804898e and 0x08048b02
and we change the eax to 2 in 0x0804898e and change eax to flag14 uid and we execute continue and at the end display the flag of level14
