we can see that in home directory of  Level09 there is executable file named level09 and a file named token

when we run the file level09 we got the result:  "You need to provied only one arg."
so we are going to run it with the argument "abc" 
$>./level09 abc
$>ace
From this result we know that level09 print the caracters after adding the index to each one #printf("%s", argv[1][i] + i);

After running level09 using token content we got:
$> ./level09 `cat token`
$> f5mpq;v�E��{�{��TS�W�����
So what we did is creating a script that do the oposite of level09 #printf("%s", argv[1][i] - i);

After running script.c using token content we got:
$> ./a.out `cat token`
$> f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
