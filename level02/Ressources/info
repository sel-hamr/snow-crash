In the home of level02 we see a file named level02.pcap

The .pcap file extension is mainly associated with Wireshark; a program used for analyzing networks so we gonna use kali linux to open the file.

in the kali linux we going to use tool named Wireshark

Wireshark is an application that is integrated with features for monitoring relevant network activity and for storing these pieces of data into 
logs and databases for future analysis.


open level02.pcap with Wireshark.

go to analyze => follow => TCP stream

the result was "ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L" In Ascci which has non printable characters so we are going to show the result in hexadecimal.
the result in hexadecimal:
66                                                 f

5f                                                 _
77                                                 w
61                                                 a
6e                                                 n

7f                                                 .
7f                                                 .

65                                                 e
6c                                                 l
7f                                                 .
4c                                                 L
30                                                 0
4c                                                 L
0d                                                 .

As we can see we have 2 kind of non printable characters 7f and 0d
7f = del;
0d = Carriage Return;
so the new result is "ft_waNDReL0L" which the password.
