Warning: Using these calls to check if a user is authorized to,
for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2)
creates a security hole,
si we that used time  between access and open by create 2 scripts 

script 1 : switch between two link symbolics one we have permission and another is token 
script 2 : loop for run level10
and we listen to port 6969 with nc

$> nc -lk 6969
$> ./script1.sh
$> ./script2.sh
