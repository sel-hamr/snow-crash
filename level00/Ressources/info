In the level00 after researching for user flag00 `find / -user "flag00"`
we see a lot of files that need permission except for /usr/sbin/john

`cat /usr/sbin/john`
$> cdiiddwpgswtgt

after trying do decrypt/decode it we find that after using `rot11` it give us `nottoohardhere` which is the password for flag00.

after connecting to user flag00 we use getflag to get the flag.
